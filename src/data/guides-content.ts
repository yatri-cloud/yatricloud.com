# Yatri Cloud: The Definitive Operations Manual

## 1. Platform Architecture & Strategy
Yatri Cloud is an enterprise-grade community and learning management system (CLMS) designed to bridge the gap between education and industry certification. 
- **Core Engine**: A hybrid architecture using Google Sheets as a synchronized database, Vercel for high-performance hosting, and a robust Proxy Layer for API security.
- **Mission**: Orchestrating the "Yatri" (Learner) journey from first gathering to verified cloud expert.

## 2. The Event Ecosystem (Lifecycle)
Efficient event management is the heartbeat of the platform. Admins manage the full lifecycle:

- **Phase 2: Live Registration**: 
  - **Dynamic Ticketing**: Configure multiple tiers (Early Bird, Standard, VIP). 
  - **Inventory Control**: Real-time tracking of registration limits.
- **Phase 3: Execution (Live)**: Managing joining links for virtual sessions (Zoom/Google Meet) and venue maps for in-person workshops.
